## Introduction

Bash is a popular Unix shell and command language that allows you to automate tasks, write scripts, and more. 
I created this repository to document my learning journey and share the scripts I have written with others who are also learning Bash.

## Usage

To use any of the scripts in this repository, simply download the script and run it in your Bash shell:

```bash main.sh ```

Make sure that the script has execute permissions before running it:

```$ chmod +x main.sh ```

## Contributing
If you have any Bash scripts that you would like to share or any improvements to suggest, feel free to contribute to this repository! Fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
